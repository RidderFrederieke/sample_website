    <h1>An Accurat Story</h1>

    <p>
        We build <strong>rock-solid, enterprise-grade software products</strong> and <strong>delightful digital
        experiences</strong> that make large
        quantities of data attractive, digestible, and actionable. We don’t simplify data, we allow users and readers to
        take in more information, enhancing their ability to connect the dots in highly complex data environments. Our
        work blends <strong><em>top-notch usability and museum-level art
        direction</em></strong> with insights from different disciplines, to turn data into visuals that power
        <a href="https://www.accurat.it/works/">apps, websites, books, artwork, AR, physical and digital
            experiences.</a>

    <h2>Background</h2>

    <h2>Founders</h2>

    <p>
        Thanks to our <em>hands-on expertise</em> around visualization challenges and data-heavy projects, we have, over
        the past six years, developed and refined our own design methodology, which is based on <strong>four core
        principles:</strong> we embrace complexity. We pursue beauty. We don't rely on standards. We know data are
        not just numbers.
